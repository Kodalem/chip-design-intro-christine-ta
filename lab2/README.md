# Introduction
This week, you will be introduced to SiliWiz, a walkthrough provided by TinyTapeout, which covers the fundamentals of semiconductors.

To provide some context: transistors are extremely tiny devices, so small that quantum effects can significantly impact their performance. Traditionally, MOSFETs have been introduced with equations such as \(I_D = k_n \left(V_{GS} - V_{th}\right)^2 \left(1 + \lambda V_{DS}\right)\), but this no longer accurately represents the behavior of modern devices. These equations only hold approximately within a limited operating region.

Given the high upfront costs of producing integrated circuits, simulation programs are employed to predict the behavior of these devices before production. These simulation programs, commonly known as SPICE programs (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis), simulate some of the most advanced models developed by humanity.

The following Hand-in Assignment will require you to spend about 3-5 hours of your time. You are expected to watch all videos and complete the sections "How do semiconductors work?", "Making ASICs" and "Working with HDLs".
