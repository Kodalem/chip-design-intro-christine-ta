# Introduction to Chip Design

This course is an introduction to the design of digital integrated circuits. It covers the basics of digital circuits, the tools used, and the process of designing a chip. The course is based on the open-source tools and the open-source PDKs. Student projects will be taped out on Tiny Tapeout.
