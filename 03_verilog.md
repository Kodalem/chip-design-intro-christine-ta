# **Verilog and Tiny Tapeout**

**Martin Schoeberl**


## Verilog Introduction

 * You learned Chisel
 * Verilog is the industry standard 
 * Used by tools as exchange format
 * Old langhuage with a lot of quirks
 * You mainly need to be able to read it
 * And a few lines to connect stuff
 * For serious work: use Chisel

## Verilog vs SystemVerilog

 * Verilog is the old standard
 * SystemVerilog is an extension
   - Adding a lot of features
     - 200+ keywords
   - Mainly for verification (with UVM)
     - E.g., object oriented programming
 * But open-source tools do not fully support SV
 * We stick to plain Verilog
