# Lab 2: Exercises with SiliWiz

This week, you will carry out some exercises using SiliWiz, a walkthrough provided by Tiny Tapeout, which covers the fundamentals of semiconductors.

## Instructions
Read the material and carry out the all exercises in order form [SiliWiz](https://tinytapeout.com/siliwiz/).

**Please note:** Feel free to skip some exercises if you are confident with the topic. Plese do not skip the "Draw a CMOS inverter" exercise.


### Common Questions

- Make sure you use "in", "Vdd", "Vss" as input, power and ground respectively to make sure that the SPICE simulator built into the SiliWiz works as intended.
- Make sure that you have added the "via" layer between the silicon and the metal.
- The current through the gate is proportional to the width and height of the polysilicon, which means that the thinner and smaller the gate, the more current can go through it.
- Higher the capacitance, the less steep the voltage drop after the charge, so you need to zoom in really deep to see the drop than the given example gives.
