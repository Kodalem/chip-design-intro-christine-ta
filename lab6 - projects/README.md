# Week 6 Exercise  
*Open Source Chip Design Course*  
*July 2024*

---

## Introduction
This is a special week as it is the last of these weekly assignments, you must complete the Hand-in Assignment and find a group for next week where you can begin your final project.

## Assignment
For the rest of the course you there will be no more weekly assignments, instead you will work on the followingly presented project.

You must find a team of 2-3 people to complete the project.

### Mandlebrot Set VGA Displayer
The Mandlebrot set is a iconic computation. Consider the eqaution:
Zn+1 = Zn + C
Where Z0 = 0
Any complex number C which is a part of the Mandlebrot set will no go towards infinity as the number of itterations goes towards infinity.

This project consists of two parts, firstly you must create a structure which is able to tell if a complex number is stable or unstable, you may assume it is stable if has not gone outside the stability circle in X itterations where X is somewhere between 10 and 20.
If the number is unstable you must color it with some color other then black, if it is stable you must color it black.

Secondly you must create a way to interface with the VGA controller [Tiny VGA](https://github.com/mole99/tiny-vga). You may use 16-bit or 32-bit fixed point representation or 16-bit or 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point representation.
It is recommended to start with a fixed point representation. If you are using a fixed-point representation it should represent the range -2 to 2 for both the real and complex part.

You may use the visual tool to check if you design displays correctly [VGA Playground](https://vga-playground.com/).

The output pins should be assigned:
```
assign uo_out = {hsync, B[0], G[0], R[0], vsync, B[1], G[1], R[1]};
```
Where R0, G0, B0 are the least significant bits and R1, G1, B1 are the most significant bits.

You must:
- Provide a working chisel/verilog code.
- Show that the project works by tests and simulating. The Simulations should be displayed using GTK-wave.
- Provide an in-depth tour of the design and your ideas.
- Provide an overview of the physical design.
- Pass all the github actions tests.

You must awnser:
- What is the max clock frequency you can operate at.
- What is the limiting factor (for increasing clock frequency) area or speed? and can you trade one for the other.
- How much power do you consume?

The project should be in a state where it should be possiable for you to commit it to tinytapeout and you should be quite sure the project would work.

Some optional additions are listed, but feel free to come up with your own ideas.
- Color: You must color the set based on level of unstability (itterations).
- Zoom: You must allow the ability to zoom using button inputs.
- Move: You must allow the ability to move the point of view using button inputs.


## Hand-in Assignment
This shall be handed in before next week. You should submit a document (preferably LaTeX) that answers the following questions.

### 1. Exploring the layout
In this assignment, you will be exploring the layout generated by OpenLane2. You are required to visit and read the following page: [OpenLane2 Configuration Reference](https://openlane2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/configuration.html).
You should explore the 7-seqment display you made last week.

1. Open the KLayout viewer using make.  
   You are now expected to show the power strips; you may disable or enable viewable layers in the "Layers." You can use "Hide all" and then the metal layer in which the power strips reside. They are called "met*.drawing." (There should be only 2 power strips.)  
   Display the power strips in your assignment.
2. Describe what a power strip is.
3. Locate the signal pins; these also reside on a metal layer. You shall outline the pins in a program like *Paint* or *GIMP*.
4. How big are the pins (you must meassure them)?
5. !?!??! Now locate and outline the power pins. If they are not there, you might want to read the docs.
6. !?!??! Change the die area to "" and core area. 
7. Describe what die area is.
8. Describe what core area is.

### 4. Notes
To remember important steps in the future, it will be a good idea for you to take notes. These will not be evaluated, but you are allowed to submit them together with the rest of your assignment. These notes are only for you and are not required.
